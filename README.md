## Pre Setup

Node.js and its official package manager npm is needed to be installed on your system.
 
There are many methods to use for installing Node on your operating system:

1.One option is to figure out proper version of Node used for out project first and than 
consult official docs at [Nodejs website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The one I downloaded is the newest version of Node.js.

2.Second option is first install Node Version Manager and then use it to install proper version of Node for this project.
Official documentation on how to install nvm can be found here: https://github.com/creationix/nvm.

## Build Setup

cd in Ro

install dependencies

``` bash
npm install
```

serve with reload at localhost:8080

## Linting and code styles

Significant amount of code style rules and guidelines are defined within our linter of choice, 
[ESLint](https://eslint.org/).
Again please install and configure eslint plugins and integrations in your IDEs and editors.
